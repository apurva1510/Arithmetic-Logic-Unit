# Arithmetic-Logic-Unit

This project is a working CAD model of an ALU developed using VHDL in Quartus 13.0. Individual components such as Encoder, Latches, Adder, Control Unit (to perform functions on the ALU), programming the Seven Segment Display and other required components were initially designed in previous lab sessions and the final project is the compilation and integration of those components.
